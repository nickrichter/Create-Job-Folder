Create Job Folder
=================

An Applescript for setting up a new folder structure for your projects



### How useful is this?

Honestly, I don't know. Probably not very, as everybody has their own way of doing things. So the structure here is likely not what you need. I made this while working at a design firm and we wanted a way to quickly create a folder structure for new projects, so it's preatty specific. However, it could always be edited to suit your specific needs. Just change the folder names, remove nested folders you don't need, and so on.

So maybe it might be useful. Perhaps just a tiny bit. Who knows.



### Installation

There is no installation per se, but this is just a plain text file of the source code, and not executable. Since AppleScript's .scpt files are compiled, binary, files they are difficult to perform diffs on, and keep track of with version control. There are a couple options to get a compiled version of the script. The first is to simply open AppleScript Editor and paste the source code into a new file. Another is to open Terminal and do the following:

1. `cd` to the directory where you want the compiled script to live
2. type `osacompile -o myscript.scpt /path/to/my/SASS-droplet.applescript` and hit return

The `-o` flag is the filename you want for the output. If the output is not specified, the default a.scpt will be used. It's also worthwhile to note, that *the output will be placed where the osacompile command is run from*. For example, if your present working directory is your user home directory, a.scpt will be put in your home directory even if SASS-droplet.applescript is on your desktop. That is why the `cd` in step 1 is important.
